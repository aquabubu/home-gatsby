If you are chasing the perfect skincare routine like most Korean girls, then one important step that you can’t miss is the essence. So what is Korean essence? Many people mistake it with the serum, so these are the differences: essences in Korea are watery, so they should be patted on your face after toner (usually called skin in Korea); thicker than serum but they both contain high concentrations of active ingredients. Anyway, today my topic is about Innisfree Soybean Energy Essence 150ml. It is sold at 35,000krw (~$35), but I got it when the brand offers 30% discount so it was just 24,500krw (~$24). I bought it at the store, but it’s also available online.

For those who are not familiar with Innisfree, it is a naturalism-oriented cosmetics brand created by Amore Pacific in 2000. It is also one of the few Korean brands that use organic ingredients certified by France's ECOCERT organization. The essence is packed in a 150ml bottle of translucent color, very cute, the outer paper box looks simple as well. The bottle is very handy and I love it.

Innisfree claims that this is an essential anti-aging essence with fermented oil and high concentrated Jeju fermented soybean extract for healthy skin with a natural glow.

  * **91% fermented Jeju soybean extract gives skin energy and resilience**

The enriched gamma-PGA from fermented Jeju soybeans, grown at an elevation of 2,034 ft. on Mt. Halla, help build a firm and dense skin barrier to help your skin fight against environmental and natural damage.

## <span style="color:blue"> How to use </span>

After washing your face, soak a cotton pad (you can use your hand if lazy) with essence and wipe it around your face, avoiding your eyes and mouth.

When I apply it, I feel a little bit sticky on my face since this essence is thicker than the toner. But don’t worry, due to the watery texture (photo above), it absorbs really fast so you won’t be bothered. Besides, it makes **my skin so smooth and soft after use**. For a long term using, my skin (combination to dry type) doesn’t feel dry anymore. This essence doesn’t have a scent as well. Very nice product for even sensitive skin. For the anti-wrinkle effect, I noticed that **my skin is lifted** (I think it requires using for a long time). But for whitening, I see nothing. Since my skin tone is not a big problem, I just skip it.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

Overall, I like this essence of Innisfree. It does a good job of moisturizing and soothing my skin or even anti-wrinkle. Do I purchase again? Let me think…If I find a better essence at that cheap price, I will change, other else, I will continue using it.

So if you have any suggestions for the essence, pls let me know ^^
