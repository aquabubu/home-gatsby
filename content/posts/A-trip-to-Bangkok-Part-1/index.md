I'm gonna share some information about my trip to **Bangkok** - Thailand. Hope it will be helpful for those who plan to travel there.

## <span style="color:red"> Silom & Patpong </span>

I decided to go to Silom night market first. There weren't many things to see from Chuck to Silom Center so we just wandered around the street. On the sidewalks, people were selling many kinds of stuff. If you want to buy some unique printed shirts, just come here. Besides, walking around and you'll see the pictures of NAKED male/female!

We also went to the famous red light street but we were not allowed to shoot. This road is quite bustling and both sides have many Japanese restaurants. The girls in cosplay invite guests along both sides of the street. I heard that the male-male street is also interesting but I just skipped it. :grin:

## <span style="color:deepskyblue"> Central Pier - Chao Phraya Express Boat </span>

The Central Pier providing a kind of water transportation service called The Chao Phraya Tourist Boat, where many high quantity colorful boats travel from pier to pier without worrying about purchasing extra boat tickets or getting lost. Although the docks are not so large, they have English signboards and even an English speaking guide.

If you go to Bangkok, don't miss this water transportation. You can see Bangkok from a whole new perspective, trust me! You can also visit many attractions such as the Temple of Dawn and the great Reclining Buddha at Wat Pho. But I decided to pass by the famous Taling Chan Floating Market first.

## <span style="color:green"> Taling Chan Floating Market </span>

When the express boat arrived, we took a taxi to Taling Chan Floating Market, which is 20km from the center but the taxi fare was quite cheap. This market has everything you need to spend a good half day and you don’t need to book a tour for it. Here you can enjoy a great seafood lunch on the floor with the locals, or having a long tail boat ride around the nearby canals for 100 baht (~$3), do shopping and tasting a lot of food. You can even get a foot massage for only 200 baht (~$6).
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

Taling Chan Floating Market is not too big and has many Thai people so the traditional specifics have still remained. Goods are also cheap, and the cuisine is so delicious and diverse. The salesmen are very mindful decorating clean, nice and orderly stalls.

Thai crispy pancake looks like Vietnamese pancakes but the taste is totally diferent. The yellow colored pancake that had additional cream layer was very sweet. While the light orange colored one tasted both sweet and salty, which I preferred more.

## <span style="color:darkorchid"> Wat Arun – Temple of Dawn </span>

Wat Arun is Bangkok's oldest temple. When King Thaksin decided to build his new capital in Thonburi he came here at dawn. So he renamed it Wat Jang, "Jang" means the cleanness, brightness of dawn. The most interesting of Wat Arun temple is the decoration of the temple gates. They are built of brick and covered with colorful Chinese porcelain.

If you wear shorts, short skirts and tank top, you must hire a long cloth to cover. As the place is quite crowded, bring your own cloth to avoid time-consuming if possible.

If you climb up the stone stairs to the balcony, you can see the panoramic view of Chao Phraya River and Bangkok from Rama I Bridge to the Grand Palace and Wat Pho.

Located next to the waterfront, Wat Arun truly becomes one of the great attractions in the capital, which allows you to have a marvelous sightseeing. It is a symbol of Bangkok tourism with very special Thai-style architecture.
