Having a flawless skin is the dream of many women in this world including me, of course! However, I don’t know why recently I got so many pimples and after they gone, the left acne scars on my face. :sob: :sob: :sob:
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

OMG, I hate those scars and I want to get rid of them. Since they make me so unconfident when going out, I decided to hide them away first before removing them completely. That’s the reason why today, I’m gonna talk about **Innisfree Mineral Essential Concealer SPF30 PA++ 6.5g**.

It’s sold at 6,000krw (~$6) but I got this concealer at Innisfree store with their 50% sale event so it was just 3,000krw (~$3). And, there are providing 3 shades.

My experience of buying concealer is that you should choose the color that 1 tone brighter than your skin tone. My skin is not that bright and my purpose is to cover the pimples and acne scars, so I chose the #2 – **Natural Beige**.

## Package
Extremely simple. It has no paper box and the seal between the lid and bottle body is quite good. Everything is written in Korean.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

## Ingredients 
Since there is no English, I just translate the ingredients from Korean.

<span style="color:royalblue"> Cyclopentasiloxane, titanium dioxide, purified water, phenyltrimethicone, talc, butyleneglycol, cetylpiperazine/piperazine-10/1 dimethicone, 10-dimethicone, niacinamide, zinc oxide, dimethicone / vinyl dimethicone cross polymer, lauryl pyridine-9 polydimethylsiloxy ethyl cholate dimethicone, sodium chloride, mash extract, green tea extract, , Camellia leaf extract, tangerine peel extract, mineral salt, distearammonium hectorite, beeswax, triethoxycaprilylsilane, panthenol, hydroxyacetophenone, palmitic acid, stearic acid, Polyoxyethylene stearate, polyoxyethylene stearate, polyoxyethylene stearate, polyoxyethylene stearate, polyoxyethylene stearate, polyoxyethylene stearate, polyoxyethylene stearate, polyoxyethylene stearate, benzoate, disodium a-dithiane A, 1,2-hexanediol, red iron oxide, yellow iron oxide, black iron oxide, perfume </span>

**Innisfree claims** that Mineral Essential Concealer is not only a product with SPF30 PA++, but also has **anti-wrinkle, whitening, coverage and moisturizing effect for all skin type (especially dry skin)**.

## How to use
I usually apply it after the cushion and use my hand or the puff to spread it. But I think that it will look more natural if you put it after the sunblock and before the cushion. (I didn’t use foundation or base. So lazy to use all of them)

**Skincare -> Sunblock -> Cushion -> Concealer**

**I say**

It is ok for that cheap price. With only one layer, it just covers well my scars, not the pimples, so I put it 2-3 layers. Moreover, after using for hours, my skin becomes dry at the area where I put on the concealer (it's probably due to the dry weather in Korea). I have no idea about anti-wrinkle efect. I don’t use it for the dark circle or wrinkles under my eyes because I am afraid that it''ll make the wrinkles even more serious.

So, if you already have a smooth skin with minor problems such as scars, this product is good and cheap. But if you need something hidden pimples perfectly, you should find another concealer. I will try another when I finish it.
