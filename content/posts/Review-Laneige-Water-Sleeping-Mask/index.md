Today I’m gonna review about the famous Water Sleeping Mask of Laneige. I know there are already so many reviews about this mask but I really love it that I want to make my own review. The **Laneige Water Sleeping Mask** is a light blue plastic box with a small spatula to scoop up enough amount to use.

Laneige means “**natural snow**” in French. This Korean brand is inspiring by snow crystals with hydrating products aimed towards younger women between ages 24 and 32.

As you may know, Korean women are really picky in their skincare because to them, having the beautiful skin means having beauty. When most women in the world have just stopped by using their moisturizer, Korean have invented the **last step of their skincare** called **sleeping mask**, used to keep moisture skin during their sleep. You will leave it on your skin before sleep and wash your face the next morning.

Sleeping mask texture is usually soft as gel, cool your skin and absorbs fast. Among of those sleeping masks in Korea, Laneige Water Sleeping Mask impresses people for its water-based products and it is safe for various skin types.  This sleeping mask originally costs 28,000krw (~$28). And, I bought this mask online on Laneige website, but at the time I bought it, it was on sale 30% so I got it at 19,600krw (~$20)

**Laneige claims** that:

  * Skin purifying effect: SLEEP-TOX™ technology’s purifying effects help to rejuvenate and normalize skin that is often fatigued and sensitized by stress during the day. This helps the skin to achieve a well-rested appearance the next morning.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

  * Skin moisturizing: MOISTURE WRAP™ helps skin retain moisture throughout the night. The dense beta-glucan moisturizing shield (network) consists of active agents such as Hydro Ion Mineral Water, evening primrose root extract, Hunza apricot extracts, and more so that skin fully absorbs the goodness during 8 hours of sleep.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

  * Skin soothing: contains skin-soothing agents that are gentle on sleeping skin, helping it recover overnight. Ultra-mild, safe formula that can be worn overnight/Non-comedogenic, sensitivity tested.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

  * Aromatic SLEEPSCENT™ helps you relax during sleep, allowing skin to relax and rest and boosting its ability to regenerate.

## How to use

<span style="color:teal"> Cleaning -> Toner -> Essence -> Eyecream -> Sleeping mask  </span>

Some bloggers said that they even use cream before applying the sleeping mask, but I don’t do it. I think these steps is enough for my skin. And, I always store this mask in the refrigerator so when I apply it, it has a cooling effect on my skin immediately. Try it, you won’t regret.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

Some people say that you can use it daily but since it contains a lot of nutrients and high water supply, 2-3 times per week is the best for me (I have dry to combination skin). If we consider our daily skincare routine as our meal, the sleeping mask will be a "tonic" that sometimes needs to be added. And, a tonic should not be used too often. But if you wonder how many times you should use it, you can try. There are no other people who understand your skin better than you so listen to it.

## I say

The texture of this sleeping mask is a "hybrid" between cream and gel form. I really like this texture especially with extremely light blue color (I :blue_heart: blue). This mask is also light and easily absorbed deep into the skin, leaving no unpleasant odor. After washing in the next morning, my skin feels moisture, smooth and brighten. Additionally, I sometimes have some redness and pimples, whenever I use this sleeping mask, the redness gone and the pimples really look better. Laneige said that the scent of this sleeping mask helps people relax, sleep better and deeper but I always sleep easily so I am not sure about it.

This is my second bottle and I really love how my skin looks after using it. But I think I'm gonna switch to another since I would like to have more experience about Korean sleeping mask. Laneige sleeping mask is greatthat I highly recommend it, especially for summer. :snowflake::snowflake::snowflake:
