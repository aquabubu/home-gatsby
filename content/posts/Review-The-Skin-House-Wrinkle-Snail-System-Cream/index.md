**Snail mucus** caught the attention of many skincare companies in Korea as this odd ingredient is famous for its skin-repairing and anti-aging properties, particularly useful in healing the skin post-breakout, and a good humectant.

Since I really fond of anti-aging skincare product and haven't used any snail creams yet, I decided to buy a set of **The Skin House Wrinkle Snail System Cream 100ml** and **Real Snail Wrinkle Free eye cream**, with only 18,400krw (50% discount on <a href="https://www.memebox.com/" target="_blank">memebox.com</a>). In this post, I will review the snail cream only. I will review the eye cream later in the next post.

## Package

The cream comes in a plastic dark brown jar with a golden lid that's as clear as a mirror. No spatula.

## Texture

The white cream is so thick and sticky, which makes it very difficult to take out (maybe all snail creams are sticky???). But once applying to skin, it goes smoothly.

## Scent

I have to say that the scent is the most uncomfortable thing about this cream. It smells like chemical to me.

## Ingredients

## How to use

  * As a finishing cream: Before going to bed, at the last step of the basic skin care, apply an adequate amount and tap it lightly to be absorbed.
  * As a massage gel for sensitive skin: When your skin becomes sensitive by the external stimulus, use toner to smooth the skin texture and apply the snail cream thickly, then massage it softly. 
  * As a moisturizing & nourishing pack: Use toner to smooth the skin texture and apply the snail cream thickly, leave it for 15~20 minutes, and then rinse off.

This cream is used as the last step in my skincare routine. Just use a little amount is enough.

## I say

To be honest, I don’t really see fancy effects on my skin as advertising. This cream is so thick and sticky that I only use it before bedtime. It does help improve my skin elasticity and remove some minimal wrinkle, but just a little. My face feels heavy and sticky whenever I use. It also takes quite long to fully absorb but the stickiness is still though it doesn’t make my face glossy. Even so, my skin still feels dry as it’s not well- moisturized. Overall, this cream is so heavy and sticky with an uncomfortable scent that is too much for summer but not enough moisture for winter. I stop using it on my face now and just use it as a hand cream instead.
