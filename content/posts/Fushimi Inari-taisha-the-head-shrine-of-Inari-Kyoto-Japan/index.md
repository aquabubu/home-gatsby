## <span style="color:orangered"> The Foxes </span>
In ancient Japan, some myths said that foxes are capable of using magic. That’s why **foxes (kitsune) are regarded as the messengers** so many fox statues often found around the shrine. There are many Inari rice cake shops decorated with foxes. There are also a few restaurants, which serve locally themed dishes such as Inari sushi and **Kitsune Udon** (Fox Udon).
