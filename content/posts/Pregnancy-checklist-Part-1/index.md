The mother-to-be needs to prepare a lot of things, not only her psychological but also many needed items. So, I'm gonna list some things that were prepared during my pregnancy as I find them quite necessary.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

## Maternity clothes
From the second month of pregnancy, I packed and stored all my skinny clothes and jeans. You choose the comfortable clothes for daily wearing. There are a lot of jeans, T-shirts for pregnant women, not only comfortable but also pretty. Of course, when shopping you should consider spending economically because you can only wear them when you are pregnant.

### <span style="color:green"> Feeding bra + breast pad </span>

<img align="left" style="width: 100px; padding: 10px" src="/assets/images/feedingbra.png"> As soon as the placenta is released from the uterus, hormone levels surge so that the body begins to increase the volume of milk. In a few first months after birth, you will experience fullness in your breasts that can only be relieved by frequent breastfeeding.

So, buying feeding bras and breast pads is very necessary. It is very convenient when you breastfeed, while also helping to support lifting your breast (you don't  want to have saggy breasts, do you?  :laughing:)

### <span style="color:orange"> Tã cho mẹ </span>

This is a very important item that you must have! After birthing, vaginal discharge - known as lochia - is a common side effect that every mom will have. therefore, you should be prepared to bring before going to the hospital for delivery.

## Necessary stuff

### <span style="color:dodgerblue"> Bottle warmer </span>

<img align="left" style="width: 200px; padding: 10px"  src="/assets/images/avent.png">This machine helps to warm up the bottle before feeding your baby. I don't have much time so I often prepare milk bottle for my son, store in the refrigerate and then use this machine to warm up before I feed him. I purchased a Philips Avent bottle warmer, along with warm milk mode, there is also a food warmer mode, so convenient. But if you are not busy and think it's not that convenient, then don't buy it.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

### <span style="color:indigo"> Breast pump </span>

As mentioned above, I don't have time, so I use this machine to suck milk, store in the refrigerator and warm up before feeding my baby. There are many types of machines, I have used Medela Swing maxi double electric breast pump and I think it's good.

I prefer to use the one with electrical appliances (or batteries) than pump by hand, which will save my time and energy.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

### <span style="color:seagreen">  Bottle sterilizer </span>

In the past, they used to sink the bottle in boiled water it to sterilize but I think it takes too much time so buy this machine. All you need to do is just wash the bottles and press the sterilize button, done. I use Philips Avent 3-in-1 Electric Steam Sterilizer - this machine is sterilized by steam. The only unsatisfied thing is that after the sterilization, the bottles are still wet because of the steam. UV sterilizers make the bottles drier, but I don't know whether the UV rays will affect the plastic quality of the bottle or not.

### <span style="color:crimson"> Bottle and pacifier </span>

<img align="left" style="width: 200px; padding: 10px"  src="/assets/images/bottle.png"> Currently, there are many baby brands such as Avent, Upis, Double Heart, Spectra... Different brands have different bottle types and pacifiers. I have used the set bottle of Double Heart and found them quite good. There are 2 sizes of bottles: 160ml and 240ml with different pacifiers size SS (newborn), S (1-3 months), M (3-6 months) and L (above 6 months ).
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

<img align="right" style="width: 200px; padding: 10px"  src="/assets/images/numvu.png"> The Double Heart pacifiers are soft and flexible, suitable for even newborn babies. Later on, I switched to Spectra's but it's harder and my son didn't like it so I had to switch again. By now I still use Double Heart. When my baby was small, I used the 160ml bottle (I bought 2 bottles). In the following months, the uptake milk volume increased, so I used 240ml bottle (4 bottles)

### <span style="color:teal"> Bottle cleaning foam </span>

<img align="left" style="width: 90px; padding: 10px"  src="/assets/images/a1.png"> I was introduced to the cleaning foam of BnB and Double Heart. I also bought a set of bottles cleaning foam + washing kit of Double Heart. But I think whichever brand is okay.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

### <span style="color:navy"> Milk storage bag </span>
<figure style="width: 200px" class="align-center">

Those who suck milk and store in the freezer should buy milk storage bag for storage and preservation. There are a few trusted brands to choose, and I like the Philips Avent.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

### <span style="color:peru"> Thermometer </span>

This is also one of the necessary things to buy. Regular check your baby's temperature is important, especially for the newborns and for those who just have the vaccination. 
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

Because after vaccination, their temperature tend to increase that they may have a fever. For babies, having a fever is always dangerous. I bought Braun's thermometer and it can be used for both babies and adults.
