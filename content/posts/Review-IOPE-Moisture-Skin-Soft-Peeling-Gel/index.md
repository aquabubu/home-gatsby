Having a flawless skin is a desire of every woman in this world, including me! So, skincare routine is very important and requires many complicated steps. And one of them is exfoliation. It not only cleans out clogged pores but also peels off dead skin cells. When you remove this dull layer on your face, your skin will be brighter. Therefore, today I’m gonna introduce you to the IOPE Moisture Skin Soft Peeling Gel 100ml. I got it online from IOPE website at a discounted price around 19,600krw (~$20) but they are also sold in Aritaum stores or some online markets. The original price is 28,000krw. I always wait for the sale to buy it.

About IOPE, it is one of the mid-end brands of Amore Pacific, based on highly-enriched herbal extracts and cutting-edge scientific technology. The IOPE skincare line includes a number of products that include both skincare items and cosmetics for both men and women.

So, **IOPE claims** that:

  * Prebiotic ingredients maintain balanced skin to fortify the skin's natural strength by protecting the skin from hazardous substances.
  * Witch hazel water, which has exceptional astringent and soothing effects, makes it gentle on sensitive skin.
  * Natural cellulose extract from trees and aloe extract gently exfoliates the skin leaving softness without dryness.

## How to use

After cleaning your face and pat drying the skin, take a nickel size onto the palm, gently massage it from the nose to the entire face, and wash it well with warm water (be careful to not stimulate the skin too much by rubbing to strongly).

I use it twice per week, and you know, after exfoliation, your skin will be very clean and dry so you can put on a sheet mask, it will absorb deep into your skin and bring good effect. Additionally, depending on your skin type that you can choose the frequency to exfoliate your skin though I think even with the oily skin, 3 times per week is enough.

**Pros**
  * Deep cleansing
  * Instantly brighten and soften the skin
  * Exfoliate dead skin cell
  * Moisture
  * Hygiene tube
  * A little goes a long way
  * Light scent, just pleasant and unassuming (sorry guys, I’m not good at demonstrating the scent )

**Cons**
  * Expensive
  * Brightening effect doesn’t last long

After all, I am quite satisfied with this IOPE Moisture Skin Soft Peeling Gel. Whenever I use it, my skin immediately becomes smoother and brighter, it doesn’t dry my skin as well. And in the next morning, my makeup will definitely go smoothly on my face. Since it’s expensive and I want to try other Korean exfoliating products, I will try others. But it’s a really nice product that I think you can give it a try. I think that I will switch to Innisfree Green Barley Gommage Peeling Mask 120ml that is only 14,000krw (~$14) and I’ll do a review later.
