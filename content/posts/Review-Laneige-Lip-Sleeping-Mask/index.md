Laneige, which is one of beauty brands of the hugest AmorePacific corporation in Korean, has a wide range of trusted products. Launched in 1994, Laneige has affirmed their position in the beauty. Along with the powerful Hallyu wave, Laneige has collaborated with many famous celebrities and beauty queen Song Hye Kyo is currently their representative.

I’m gonna review another Laneige product for beauty called **Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask** - one of the most famous skincare products of Laneige. There is 4 types of lip sleeping mask: 베리 (Sweet Berry Complex), 자몽 (Sweet Citrus), 애플라임 (Citrus Green Fruity) and 바닐라 (Sweet Vanilla). At first, I wanted to buy the berry but it was out of stock so I picked vanilla instead at 30% discounted price 12,600krw on their website. But actually, the smell of berry and vanilla is not so different!

## Package & Texture

In a paper box, the product is packed in a glass jar with a plastic lid for easy, safe and effective preservation. Glass bottles are thick without fragile feeling. The lip mask texture is as smooth as butter. (As you can see the photo above, the paper box looks quite different comparing to the original one since it's the holiday edition).

There is also a lovely brush with a pink flexible silicone head dedicated to take cream and apply to lips. Glass vases and spoons are packed in a paper box that looks quite elegant, can be used as a very suitable gift.

## Scent

It has a sweet strawberry scent, really pleasant aroma. I swear that this scent is so 'delicious' that makes me want to bite (but no taste of course). But it doesn't last long.

## Laneige claims that

Sleeping mask for the lips will gently wipe the dead cells on the lips to make it become smooth and elastic.

## How to use

  * Before going to bed, apply a liberal amount with the spatula.
  * Gently wipe the lips clean with tissue or cotton pad the next morning
For me, I use it every night before going to sleep. And, I also use it during the day as a lip balm whenever my lips feel dry and need to be moisture.

## I say
This lip mask is perfect for me. When using it at night, it goes smoothly on lips, forms a thin layer and does make my lips softer and moisturizing until the next morning. When I use it in the daytime, the effect is also immediately and it can last up to about 2 hours in the winter season (~-10oC). Of course, you’ll need to re-apply after eating or drinking. A 20g jar is also last long, I usually take some to a small jar to use. I have been using it for nearly half year and it still remains a lot, a little goes a long way. Besides, I’m really fond of its scent, so sweet (I bet it’s perfect for kissing :kiss:).

However, it doesn’t remove dead cells as it claims and, some may find it a little bit greasy and heavy when using. And if you use it before makeup, just use a little amount or your lipstick can’t stay long.

Laneige has never disappointed me with their sleeping mask products, first the water sleeping mask and now, this lip sleeping mask. I will definitely re-purchase this lip sleeping mask, but I would like to try other scents.
