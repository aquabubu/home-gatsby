If you want to go to South Korea and find a place to entertain – a bustling, funny and big enough for a whole day playing, why don’t you take a chance on Everland. It is a <span style="color:PaleVioletRed">**Korea's largest theme park** </span>, operated by SAMSUNG cooperation and located at the Everland Resort in Yongin City. Along with its main attractions, **Everland** includes a **zoo** and **water park** known as **Caribbean Bay**, but I’m not confidence wearing bikini so I just skip the Bay . I’ll show you in details about Everland theme park which has **5 different zones**: Global Fair, American Adventure, Magic Land, European Adventure, and Zootopia.
This is  <a href="http://www.everland.com/web/multi/english/everland/main.html" target="_blank">Everland website. </a>

### <span style="color:deepskyblue"> Global Fair </span>
It’s primarily a place for food, souvenirs, and pictures. The cheerful music is played along the street lined with many beautiful architectures from all over the world. Once you enter the park, you’ll see this zone first. You can also find needed services such as stroller rental and lockers here. (I did take many nice photos here :camera:)

The cable car was also good. Slow speed helps you enjoy the scene!

### <span style="color:crimson"> American Adventure </span>
This zone is based on the theme of 500 years of American history, from the time when Columbus discovered the American Continent to the 1960s when Elvis Presley ruled the music record. In this zone, you can experience many thrilling games. (thrilling things are not my style, so I just took a look in this zone guys :sweat_smile:)

### <span style="color:blueviolet"> Magic Land </span>
Magic land is an area with buildings and rides, mostly for kids. There is a place called Aesop's Village - a cute little fairy tale land based on the fables of Aesop. Along with the rides, there are many restaurants and stands. I didn't spend much time here, but the Rotating House was good. :smile:

### <span style="color:olive"> European Adventure </span>
Wonderful flowers in a seasonal garden such as tulips, roses are in bloom throughout the year. This theme zone also provides many attractions especially the T-express - Korea's first wooden coaster with a prefabricated track, the first ride of this type in Asia, and the first to employ three trains. It is world's fourth steepest wooden roller coaster, world's ninth fastest, fourth tallest, and sixth longest wooden coaster. Due to the hillside, T-express also takes advantage of the high terrain.

This is my most favorite zone in Everland theme park. ZooTopia is an animal-themed portion including a petting zoo, pony rides, and animal shows. You can see polar bears, sea lions, penguins, bears, tigers, and primates in a tiny zoo as well.

<img align="left" style="width: 150px; padding: 10px" src="/assets/images/everland-11.png"> **Safari Bus**, **Lost Valley**, and **Amazone Express** are the most exciting attractions in this zone that you MUST NOT miss them.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

<img align="right" style="width: 150px; padding: 10px" src="/assets/images/everland-15.png"> The Safari Bus ride shows animals such as ligers (a hybrid of lion and tiger) and bears in a contained habitat while the visitors stay inside the bus. Amazon Express is a raft ride, where most visitors get a cool splash of water along the 580-meter long water path. And for the Lost Valley that you will move from water to land, it has approximately 150 unique animal species roam freely.

###  <span style="color:blue"> How to get there </span>

You can get there by either subway or bus

By **subway** Jeondae-Everland Station (Yongin EverLine), Exit 3. And then, take the shuttle bus to Everland (Operating hours 05:30-23:30).
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

By **bus**
  * Sinnonhyeon, Gangnam, Yangjae Stations: Bus 5002
  * Pangyo, Segok-dong, Suseo, Songpa, Jamsil, Gangbyeon Stations: Bus 5700
  * Sadang, Nambu Terminal Stations (via Bundang and Gwangju): Bus 1500-2
  * Gangbyeon, Gangdong Stations (via Gwangju): Bus 1113

**SO**, I highly recommend Everland theme park for one day guys. But you need to choose the games wisely and pick the right day or you'll be wasting time considering and standing in line for your turn. I visited there in the Children's Day holiday in Korea so there was crowded and I wasted most of the time standing in line. That's the reason I had to skip some parts.  And one thing, the perfect time to go there is Spring (March, Apr, May) and Autumn (Sep, Oct, early Nov), the weather is cool and not too shiny. Since you have to walk a lot, NEVER go in summer!
