The diversity of food is one of the most memorable things in Hong Kong due to its past as a British colony and long history of being an international port of commerce. There is an unlimited variety of food from the roadside stalls to the most upscale restaurants. And, after being here, I can understand why it is called "Gourmet Paradise" and "World's Fair of Food". Now, let's see what is special about their food. Therefore, I will introduce some restaurants and foods that I enjoyed during my trip to Hong Kong and give some comments on them.

## <font color="#CE9CF8"> Sing Heung Yuen (2 Mei Lun Street, Central) </font>

From Sheung Wan MTR Station, it takes 6 min walk from Exit A2 and the restaurant opens at 8 a.m. This place is actually on Gough Street, quite difficult to find.  We had 1 milk tea, 1 tomato noodles, 2 slices of honey roasted sandwich – HK$56 in total. The milk tea was extremely good for a fan like me and Sing Heung Yuen is a famous noodle restaurant in Hong Kong, especially tomato topping. If you like tomato, try this certainly.

## <font color="lightcoral"> Kau Kee Restaurant (Gough Street) </font>

Open hour: 12h30-22h30. This restaurant is opposite to the Sing Heung Yuen above. Quite crowded and there were people standing in line even at 2 p.m.

In Hong Kong, the taste of the food is different from restaurants. The Curry beef noodle was quite fatty and strong smell. Not recommend to those who can't eat fatty things, you can try the beef noodles instead.

## <font color="mediumseagreen"> Sister Wah noodle in Tin Hau </font>

From Tin Hau MTR Station, it takes 1 min walk from Exit A2 to a family restaurant. Though the place was small, there were many people standing in the line waiting. The restaurant closes at 11 p.m.

The owner can speak only a little English but he's funny. When I was still considering about choosing food, I told him "wait a minute" then he said "1 minute" and started...counting. lol

I had a Sister Wah with delicious broth and soft tendon beef. In Hong Kong, they don't put vegetables into the noodles, but you can order a stir fry shanghai bok choy if you want. The dish named Drunk Chicken sounded interesting so I ordered it. Half of the chicken was soaked in cold alcohol, it had an odor of alcohol and sweet taste. Delicious!

## <font color="dodgerblue"> Kam Wah Cafe (G/F, 47 Bute Street, Prince Edward) </font>

In Prince Edward MTR Station, I took a 3 min walk from Exit B2 for a breakfast at Kam Wah Cafe (open at 6:30 a.m).
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

The Polo Bun (Pineapple Bun) is a pineapple pancake with honey butter - the most famous one in this cafe. Even though I don't like the pineapple jam, this cake tasted really good. I also tried the French Toast and Egg Tart but the Polo Bun were the best and the milk tea here was twice as big as that in other places.

## <font color="DarkGoldenrod">Australia Dairy Company (G/F, 47-49 Parkes Street, Jordan) </font>

From Jordan MTR Station, it took a 2 min walk from Exit C2. I've never eaten such a delicious scrambled eggs - well folded, so fluffy, and served on the bread dripping with butter. If you see empty seat, then just go for it cause the place is always crowded. You might have to share the table with others.

I had Scrambled egg with toasted bread, Spaghetti with ham and a cup of milk tea. They were really delicious, whether you eat them together with the bread, or you eat them alone. Especially, the Scrambled egg with toasted bread was a star of the show.

## <font color="Darkcyan">Hui Lau Shan </font>

Next to Australia Dairy Company is Hui Lau San. The dessert here was good but that of Chung Kee Dessert is much better. Since I was totally full, I just had mango desserts.

## <font color="Deepskyblue"> Chung Kee Dessert (Shop CB5, Smiling Plaza, 162-188 Un Chau Street, Cheung Sha Wan) </font>

It took 5 min walk from exit A2 of Cheung Sha Wan MTR station to this place. To be honest, the dessert here was much better than Hui Lau Shan. Hui Lau Shan may have a stronger brand system and easier to find, but about the taste, Chung Kee dessert is highly recommended by the native people.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

**Six Fortune Rice Dumpling**: The rice balls had different tastes served with ginger soup. I couldn't differentiate all of them but it was still delicious!
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

**Coffee Pudding**: This one was strange! The strange thing was not the cream but how it looked: like a cake but not the cake. It is very hard using the scoop to scrape out the powder. But when eating, it melted inside and cold like ice cream even though it wasn't melted away if leaving out for a long time.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

**Mango ice cream**: Mango ice cream, mango sauce, full of things like jelly, fruit, beans and shaved ice. Delicious tasting, better than Hui Lau Shan.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

Though I was already full, I still wanted to eat more so I chose the **Durian cake**. It is so delicious!

Located in the middle of Ladies Market and slightly covered by stalls in the market, the noodles here were good but quite expensive compared to other places.

## <font color="maroon">Wai Kee Noodle Cafe </font>

From Sham Shui Po station, it took 1 min walk from Exit B2. This place open at 6:30 a.m. This place is also crowded and they don't use chopsticks, just use spoon and fork. If it's pig liver noodle that you want, come here! Though the noodle looks messy, the taste is really good. And if you drink milk tea, choose the ice one, it's much better.

You definitely can't miss the unique **Taufu Fa** of this place. Tau Fu Fa was served with sugar syrup that was so soft and silky smooth. The taste was just slightly sweet. Besides, the fried Tau Fu was freshly made and then pan-fried. Taste very good when eating with satay. Soy milk was also delicious here (best soy milk I've ever tried).

## <font color="darkorange">  Lin Heung Tea House (160 Wellington)</font>

Finally, the best restaurant of the most delicious dim sum in Hong Kong. You need to have a small piece of paper to order food. The waiter will bring the paper and ask what you want to drink. Tea is free here and they will give you a tea set. If you don't know what to do with the tea set, don't worry, the elder around you will teach you even though they don't speak English.

As for the dim sum, here is the famous dim sum restaurant so the dim sum dishes are ALL delicious. Do not be afraid when choosing what to eat. I :blue_heart: this place!
