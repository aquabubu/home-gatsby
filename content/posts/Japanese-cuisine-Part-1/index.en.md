Japanese cuisine usually emphasizes the fresh and pure taste of their food. The taste of Japanese dishes is often mild, delicious and suitable for their natural season. Due to the location surrounded by the sea, seafood and seaweed occupy a large part of the Japanese food. In addition, processed foods from soybeans are also a special point in Japanese cuisine. 

As for the drink, the Japanese are famous for their tea blends, especially the pure green tea powder made by the Zen master - the main tea for tea ceremonies. High-grade sakamai rice alcohol called sake, derived from the rituals of the Shinto is also very popular. Besides, Japanese dishes also reflect the sophisticated aesthetic thought and craftsmanship of the cook when decorating the dishes, so that guests can see the beauty of the food container as well.

Below is the list of some tasty and special dishes in Japan that one can’t miss when being there.
