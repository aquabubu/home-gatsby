If you wanna go to South Korea (especially hanging out around Seoul) then you can‚Äôt miss this place: **Gyeongbok Palace**. It was not only the main royal palace of the Joseon dynasty but also one of the most famous check-in landmarks in Seoul.

Although there are still other palaces, Gyeongbokgung remains as the biggest and most beautiful one with relatively intact **Gyeonghoeru Pavilion** and **Hyangwonjeong Pond**. The old pavilions have impressive architecture and the pond is so green and peaceful! But be prepared ‚Äì you have to walk a lot! üòé 
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

Luckily, I went there in Spring so there was cherry blossom and the weather was really nice (neither too cold nor too hot). And right before you enter the **Gwanghwamun Gate**, there is a big statue of **King Sejong**.

**Geunjeongjeon Hall**: the throne hall where the king formally granted audiences to his officials, gave declarations of national importance, and greeted foreign envoys and ambassadors during the Joseon dynasty.

**Gyeonghoeru Pavilion**: This place was used to greet foreign ambassadors or to feast the banquets, mostly for official functions.

**Hyangwonjeong Pond**: a pavilion-style building that was used for relaxation or banquets. It is imilar in function as the Gyeonghoeru Pavilion but smaller in size and used for private occasions.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

When you are at the palace, you can also visit the **National Palace Museum of Korea** (locate in the south of Heungnyemun Gate), and the **National Folk Museum** (in eastern side within Hyangwonjeong).

I also tried the King‚Äôs clothes there though I had to stand in the long line waiting. :sweat:

### <span style="color:olive"> Tips </span>
  * If you wanna try the night season, from 7 p.m to 10 p.m,  you need to make a reservation which is only available on the <a href="http://ticket.interpark.com/Global/index.asp" target="_blank">Inter Park Website</a>. Besides, it‚Äôs not available all year round, so you need to check. (I didn‚Äôt try it last time so I definitely book it if I go again.)
  * If you go to Gyeongbok palace in summer, I recommend you not to go there in the day time, it‚Äôs scorching weather. üòìüòìüòì
  * The best time to go to Gyeongbok palace is spring and Autumn. Trust me! Cherry blossom in spring and red maple leaves in Autumn will make your photos fabulous. :blue_heart:
  * My Korean friend said that if you rent the Hanbok (Korean Traditional clothes) from some shops around the palace, you can get free ticket to enter and take nice photos with the Hanbok. I didn‚Äôt try it yet.

### <span style="color:MediumVioletRed"> Admission Fees </span>
Adults (ages 19-64): ~$3/Groups (10 people or more): ~$2,5
{: style="text-align: justify;"}
Children (ages 7-18): ~$1,5/Groups (10 people or more): ~$1,2
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

### <span style="color:dodgerblue"> How to get there </span>
**Address**: 161, Sajik-ro, Jongno-gu, Seoul or ÏÑúÏö∏ÌäπÎ≥ÑÏãú Ï¢ÖÎ°úÍµ¨ ÏÇ¨ÏßÅÎ°ú 161 (ÏÑ∏Ï¢ÖÎ°ú) in Hangeul.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

If you go there by **taxi**, just show the driver this address.

If you are in Seoul or places near the capital, the **subway** is the most convenient one I think. And you can get off at Gyeongbokgung Station (Seoul Subway Line 3) and Exit 5 or Anguk Station (Seoul Subway Line 3) and Exit 1.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

If you are not familiar with the subway system, then just download the **subway app** to your smartphone and choose the station you need. It will also show you how many stations you will pass by and how long it will take. So convenient, isn‚Äôt it? üòÄ
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

I was in Suwon so I used subway line 1 and then transfer to line 3 to get there ^^

Another option is the **bus**, take bus No. 1020, 7025,109, 171, 172, 601 or 606 and get off at **Gyeongbokgung Palace Bus Stop**.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

Additionally, you‚Äôll need a **T-money card**, which is a transportation card that can be used on public buses and subways. If you go travel to Korea, just get one. It‚Äôs only ~$2.5 and you can buy one from every convenience stores (GS25, CU, 7-Eleven, Ministop,etc.). For recharging, you can do it in all sales locations and card reload devices inside subway stations.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

Overall, I like this place as a famous check-in landmark and I would like to recommend Gyeongbok Palace in Spring and Autumn. You will have fancy photo shoots with cherry blossom üå∏ or red maple leaves üçÅ and you will have a chance to understand more about Korea in the ancient time. üôÇ
