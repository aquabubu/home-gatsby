Whenever the winter comes, my skin always feels dry and I even get many dry patches. I always get a headache thinking of what kind of moisturizer I should use to protect and moisture my skin. Fortunately, I was introduced to the <span style="color:deepskyblue">**Cicaplast Baume B5 of La Roche-Posay**</span> and I immediately bought a 100ml tube at Oliveyoung store, ~$30. After a long time using, now I decide to write a review about it :snowflake: :snowman: :snowflake: :snowman: (sorry, it's been a long time so I can't find the box, I probably threw it away).

So, the very first **impression of** it is:
  * Big plastic white tube (100ml) which is very hygiene when used 
  * White cream (very dense)
  * No scent at all
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

**The manufacturer claims** that Cicaplast Baume B5 is a multi-purpose balm to soothe and calm dry, irritated skin with:
  * Panthenol to soothe dry, rough skin
  * Shea Butter & Glycerin to nourish skin and help visibly reduce the signs of irritations caused by dryness
  * [Madecassoside] + [Copper - Zinc - Maganese] that helps to visibly reduce the appearance of dry, irritated skin

## Ingredients
<span style="color:royalblue"> Aqua/Water, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter/Shea Butter, Panthenol, Butylene Glycol, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Propanediol, Cetyl Pef/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone, Tristearin, Zinc Gluconate, Madecassoside, Manganese Gluconate, Magnesium Sulfate, Disodium Edta, Copper Gluconate, Acetylated Glycol Stearate, Polyglyceryl-4 Isostearate, Sodium Benzonate, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorhexidine Digluconate, CI 77891 / Titanium Dioxide </span>

## How to use
  * Use to nourish and soothe dry areas and signs of irritation caused by dryness
  * Apply twice daily to cleansed, dry skin
  * Can be applied to body, face, and lips
  * Generous layers can be applied to overly dry areas
  * Avoid eye area

## So, this is my experiences about this Cicaplast B5:
I’ve tried this cream not only on my face but also my elbows, knees, as well as my lips. For me, this cream is totally perfect to moisturize and calm my skin immediately. For skincare, I use it both in the morning and before go to sleep. If applying on face, it will be very shiny (especially for oily skin), but I have dry to combination skin so I find it normal. In addition, it takes a few minutes to absorb completely, and a little bit sticky if you touch your skin, but it doesn’t leave the white cast or uncomfortable feeling so I don’t mind. After wake up and wash my face, my skin looks smooth and soft and doesn’t feel dry at all.

However, this cream just doesn’t work for acne spots and scars. When I have some acne breakouts on my face, this cream neither removes them nor causes them more serious.

## Here is my conclusion for this Cicaplast Baume B5:

### Advantages
  * Moisture very dry skin and can be used for various dry areas in your body
  * Tested under dermatological and pediatric control. Tested on sensitive skin => safe for even sensitive skin,   suitable for all skin types
  * Paraben-Free. Fragrance-Free. Lanolin-Free
  * Reasonable price and easy to buy
  * Very hygiene tube type 

### Drawbacks
  * Short shelf life.
  * The cream is so dense that hard to spread out
  * No other functions, just moisturizing and calming

I **highly recommend** it for those who have very dry to combination skin. Try it and you will see the significant difference after using in a short time (in my case, I see it immediately). I haven’t seen any negative reviews of this cream. It doesn’t cause breakouts or allergic. It’s even safe for baby skin.

After finishing this tube, I think that I will buy another face cream since I want something that has brightening and anti-aging effects for my skin but I will choose it again in winter.
