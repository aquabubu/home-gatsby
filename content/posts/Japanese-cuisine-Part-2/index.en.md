In the <a href="http://aquabubu.com/en/Japanese-cuisine-Part-1/" target="_blank">previous post</a>, I have introduced the main food in Japan. Now, let's continue with their unique street food.^^

### <span style="color:royalblue">Okonomiyaki (お好み焼き)</span>

Okonomiyaki is a savory pancake filled with any number of things (but usually cabbage and pork), mixed into a batter and grilled. It is topped with fish flakes, dried seaweed, mayonnaise and a Worcester-style sauce. So delicious! This one is one of my favorites in my Japan trip. 

### <span style="color:coral">Yakitori (焼鳥)</span >

This is the charcoal grilled chicken. Nearly every part of the chicken is on the menu, all grilled to perfection, seasoned with either shio (salt) or tare (a sweet soy sauce-based sauce) and served with a side of friendly banter. Taste good, but nothing’s special. However, you should try if this is your first time here.

### </span><span style="color:darkturquoise">Nikuman (ニクマン)</span>

<img align="right" style="width:250px; padding: 10px" src="./nikuman.png"> Nikuman is the Japanese name for Chinese Baozi dumplings filled with pork. It tastes goods but I prefer the taste of dumplings in Vietnam.

Grilled squid. The portion of squid served may be the whole body (except the entrails), rings cut from the body, or one or more tentacles, depending on the size. A good street food you should try.

### <span style="color:mediumvioletred">Takoyaki (たこ焼き)</span>

<img align="left" style="width:250px; padding: 10px" src="./takoyaki.png"> Takoyaki is a kind of dumpling, made from grilled puffs of seasoned batter with a small piece of octopus meat in the middle, with sauces and seasonings scattered along the top. This savory dish is very famous and even appears in other Asia countries.

### <span style="color:deeppink">Senbei (せんべい)</span>

<img align="right" style="width:250px; padding: 10px" src="./senbei.png"> Senbei is a traditional Japanese snack made from rice. It tastes good, and there are many kinds of Senbei in Japan.

Doraemon is my most favorite Japanese manga, and he loves this dorayaki. Therefore, nothing can stop me from trying this cute cake - а red bean pancake which consists of two small pancake-like patties made from castella wrapped around a filling of sweet Azuki red bean paste.

### <span style="color:olivedrab">Mochi (餅)</span>

Japanese rice cake made of mochigome, a short-grain japonica glutinous rice. There are so many kinds of them. If you like sweety things, mochi is definitely a right choose for you.
