Korea was once an originally agricultural nation, since ancient times rice has been cultivated as their staple food and until now, boiled rice is eaten with almost every dish. The Korean also like to mix rice with other grains. And they really have various kinds of main dish from rice.

## <span style="color:olive">  Noodles (면류) </span>

In Korea, noodles are collectively referred to as "guksu" in native Korean or "myeon” in Sino-Korean vocabulary. Korean people love noodles and there are many types of them, based on different ingredients and the way they are cooked. Below is the list of some of the most popular noodles in Korea.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

<span style="color:dodgerblue"> **Guksu (국수)** </span>

<img align="left" style="width:250px; padding: 10px" src="/assets/images/kkaguksu.png"> **Kalguksu (칼국수)** - knife-cut wheat flour noodles served in a large bowl with seafood-based broth and other ingredients. THis food taste fine but no meat in it.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

<img align="right" style="width:250px; padding: 10px" src="/assets/images/bibimguksu.png"> **Bibimguksu (비빔국수)** - thin wheat flour noodles served with a spicy sauce made from gochujang and vinegar. Half a hard-boiled egg, thinly sliced cucumber, and sometimes chopped kimchi are added as garnishes. With this food, you can taste obviously the sour and spicy of the chili sauce, delicious, but quite spicy so if you can't eat spicy things, don't put too much spicy sauce.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

<img align="left" style="width:250px; padding: 1px" src="/assets/images/kongguksu.png"> **Kongguksu (콩국수)** - wheat flour noodles in a bowl of soy milk broth. Kongguksu is a popular summer dish, served with ice. Smell and taste good, but no meat at all.

<img align="right" style="width:250px; padding: 10px" src="/assets/images/japjae.png"> <span style="color:mediumpurple"> **Japchae (잡채)** </span> - Sweet potato noodles (cellophane noodles) stir-fried with thinly sliced beef and vegetables; it may be served either hot or cold. To me, this noodles is quite oily so I'm not a fan of it.
  {: style="text-align: justify;"}

<span style="color:red"> **Naengmyeon (냉면)** </span> - thin buckwheat noodles either served in a cold soup or served with a gochujang-based sauce; the noodles and other ingredients are stirred together before eating. It’s a seasonal dish that is only available in Summer.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

<img align="left" style="width:250px; padding: 10px" src="/assets/images/nengmyeon-1.png"> **Mul naengmyeon (물냉면)** - literally "water cold noodles." It is served in a bowl of a tangy cold soup made with beef broth or dongchimi. Vinegar and/or mustard sauce can be added to taste. This naengmyeon is good, except that it has no meat.

Most of the noodles in Korea are cooked with vegetables. They only use bone and meat or seashell fish to cook the broth. I rarely found any noodles with meat in it.

## <span style="color:deeppink"> Soups and stews  (국 & 찌개) </span>

In Korean, soup is served as part of the main dish rather than the appetizer. Soups are known as **guk** and often made with meats, shellfish, and vegetables. Soups can be made into the formal soups known as tang (bigger in size). 
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

While **Jjigae** is a thicker, heavier seasoned stews. It is similar to a Western stew. There are many varieties depending on what the dish is made of (meat, seafood, tofu, soybean or kimchi). It is served in a broth seasoned with gochujang, doenjang, ganjang or saeujeot, and come in a communal dish and boiling hot.

<img align="right" style="width:300px; padding: 10px" src="/assets/images/bowl.png"> Korean people always have the soup or stew together with a small bowl of rice call gonggibab (공기밥). In Korean, they usually use the bowl, chopsticks and spoons which are made of metal.

  * **Haejangguk (해장국)** - usually consists of dried Napa cabbage, vegetables and meat in a hearty beef broth. This soup is delicious and I think the kimchi to eat with it is much better than that in other dishes.

  * **Sundaeguk (순대국)** - includes a kind of blood sausage made with intestine stuffed with pig's blood and other ingredients.
  * **Samgyetang (삼계탕)** – this is **Korean legend ginseng chicken soup** consists primarily of a whole young chicken (poussin) - filled with garlic, rice, jujube, and ginseng. This is really a hot soup but the Korean always have it and drink either ginseng liquor or soju (Korean alcohol) in the traditionally hottest days in the summer—chobok, jungbok, and malbok, according to the lunar calendar because they think "fight fire with fire". 
  * **Saengseonjjigae (생선찌개)**, made with fish.
  * **Sundubujjigae (순두부찌개)**, made with uncurdled soft tofu.
