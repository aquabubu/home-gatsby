Actually, after birthing, I was more stressed than when I was pregnant. I am worried and become hot-tempered, or yelling at everyone in my family. That is not good at all. So I will talk about some issues after birth, hope it will help the new mothers feel less worry and stressful after the baby is born.

## <span style="color:dodgerblue"> Constipation - Most common problem </span>

<img align="left" style="width: 150px; padding: 10px" src="/assets/images/taobon.png"> It is a delicate matter after birth that most mothers encounter, especially with those who have a normal delivery and episiotomy. So, it is advisable to eat plenty of vegetables, drink plenty of water, and eat easy-to-digest foods. I often ate a seaweed soup (Koreans eat seaweed soup cause it helps their breastfeeding milk). Besides, I also ate a quick meal like pumpkin porridge or carrot porridge after dinner.

## <span style="color:orange">  Breast milk or formula milk?  </span>

It takes 1-2 days that you can breastfeed your baby after birth. Notice that the first milk is called colostrum that's full of antibodies and immunoglobulins, which not only help protect newborns as they come into our world of bacteria and viruses but also has a laxative effect that helps them expel the tarry first stools called meconium. Therefore, it is necessary to feed your baby this colostrum. Breastfeeding mothers also have to pay attention to their diet, do not eat sour or hot, spicy food.

<img align="left" style="width: 170px; padding: 10px" src="/assets/images/formulamilk.png">I didn't have much breast milk so I feed my baby with both breast milk and formula milk. However, in the first 6 months, breastfeeding is very good for the baby, and you should breastfeed your baby at least one year. After 6 months, you can feed your baby a little bit of formula milk gradually and begin the process of solid feeding. I was lucky because my baby was very healthy. During 9 months, he grew healthy and didn't have any illness.

## <span style="color:seagreen">  Which formula milk is good for the baby? </span>  

I can't say for sure which is good and which is bad since there are many types of formula milk on the market. However, I can review on three types of Korean formula milk used to my baby:
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

<img align="left" style="width: 150px; padding: 10px" src="/assets/images/xo.png"> **NAMYANG Imperial XO**: My baby was fed by this milk in the hospital when he was born, so I think this milk is fine. But it's quite sweet, unlike breast milk. NAMYANG I Am Mother and ILDONG FOODIS Goat Milk is better and more expensive. So when finishing the 400g of XO (free from the hospital), I switched to I Am Mother.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

<img align="right" style="width: 170px; padding: 10px" src="/assets/images/iam.png">**NAMYANG I Am Mother**: Same company with XO but higher quality, taste like breast milk. This milk is easy to drink and have a high nutritional index. One thing I like about this milk is that it has a version for newborn to 100 days. There are many formula milk brands divided into every 6 months period and I don't like that. This milk is more expensive than XO but much better.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

<img align="left" style="width: 170px; padding: 10px" src="/assets/images/goat.png">**ILDONG FOODIS Goat Milk**: This milk is slightly more expensive than I Am Mother. After my baby reached his 4 months-old, I switched to this milk because it not only has high nutritional content but also very good for the digestive system of the baby. Since using this goat milk, my baby pooed easily every day. After 6 months-old, I start the solid feeding for my baby gradually and there's still no sign of constipation. Every day he poos evenly.

## <span style="color:indigo"> How to store milk correctly? </span>

For breast milk, after pumping out and put in milk storage bag, it can be stored in a fridge freezer. At a temperature from 25oC to 35oC, it can be kept from 6 hours to 8 hours, frozen milk can be stored 3 months, and at 4oC it can be stored 3-5 days. When storage, remember to note the starting date for each milk storage bag.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

The formula milk put in refrigerator compartment can be kept up to 24 hours, but I only keep for 6-8 hours. Store the milk can in a dry place and stay away from the sun. For excess milk after feeding the baby, if he/she can drink it after 30 minutes then it's okay, but longer than that, the mother should drink or throw it, don't put it back to the refrigerator.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

And one thing to keep in mind is that always warm up the milk before feeding your baby. When warming the milk, use warm water or a bottle warmer. Absolutely do NOT use a microwave oven to heat or boil milk as it will destroy the nutrients in the milk.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

## <span style="color:teal"> Breastfeeding or Bottle feeding? </span>

<img align="right" style="width: 180px; padding: 10px" src="/assets/images/ti.png"> In my opinion, you should feed your baby in both ways, so you can save your time and be active in your work. You can put breast milk into bottle and feed your baby. 
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

## <span style="color:crimson"> Baby sleeping time </span>

<img align="left" style="width: 275px; padding: 10px" src="/assets/images/babysleeping.png">Along with the feeding issue, the baby's sleep also makes many moms worry. In the first month, most babies have a lot of short sleep about 2-3 hours and just wake up to drink milk or change diaper only. Usually, when little baby crying, it's due to these four main problems: needing to change the diaper, feeling hungry, feeling too hot or too cold and crying because he/she likes it.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

So as soon as he/she wakes up and cries, you should check the diaper first, even if the baby doesn't cry, after 2-3 hours, diaper should be changed to comfort your baby. Then after feeding the baby, you should swaddle he/she tightly and put the baby back to sleep. If the baby crying because he/she like it, you can try to cuddle, sing a lullaby, breastfeed your baby. If the baby's temperature is normal, and everything above is done but still crying, then...I don't know. There are many methods for baby sleep training as Cry it out, No tears ... I tried but I just can't see my baby cried like that so I stopped it. And now, I discovered another method: lie next to my baby and breastfeed him to sleep. I think if you lie next to your baby, he/she will sleep better and deeper.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

After 2 months I slept with my baby, he slept well up to 4-5 hours after got breastfeed. From 4-5 months, my baby can sleep from 8 p.m to 6 a.m the next morning (of course, the baby must be fed before sleeping). If you lie next to your baby and breastfeed him/her, remember to change the side to keep the baby's head in good shape.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

There will come a period that the baby will cry all the night called "wonder week", usually from 5-8 weeks. Our babies will sleep less and eat less but cry a lot. But don't worry, when the period is passed, everything will be back to normal. 
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

## <span style="color:navy"> Sleep with your baby. Should or should not? </span>
Any mothers who like to sleep with her baby, just do it. It doesn't matter if your 3 years-old baby can sleep alone Because, at that time, he/she can distinguish gender differences. Besides, sleeping alone can help improving self-sufficient and the parents also have their own privacy.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

## <span style="color:peru">  My baby got diarrhea. What should I do? </span>

A few days after birth, my baby got diarrhea, probably due to Rotavirus. This is a common problem, but my baby was too small to be vaccinated for this type of virus, so the doctor recommended adding oresol to water to supplement the baby. But my son didn't like the taste and he just spat up. My baby was dehydrated so I just fed him as usual but breastfeeding frequently. A few days later, the diarrhea was healed by himself. If your baby has such symptoms, take the baby to the hospital soon to get advice from the doctor, but don't worry.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

## <span style="color:darkcyan">  Getting a slight fever, feeling uncomfortable and crying after vaccination </span>

My baby's health is quite good, and after vaccination, his body's temperature is only a bit higher than normal. In his first 2 months, he was uncomfortable and cried at night. I was tired at that time so when my son crying, his father took care of him...all the night. But later, I have experience that every time he feels uncomfortable, breastfeed him as much as I can, it will comfort him right away.
When he grows bigger, vaccination is nothing to him.

## <span style="color:sienna"> Jaundice in healthy newborns </span>

Jaundice, a common condition in newborns, refers to the yellow color of the skin and whites of the eyes that happens when there is too much bilirubin in the blood. In most cases, newborn jaundice doesn't need treatment. Just give your baby sun exposure every day. Mild jaundice will go away after 1 or 2 weeks. For high levels of jaundice, phototherapy - treatment with a special light that helps rid the body of the bilirubin - can be used. You can notice your baby breathing, if he/she breaths strongly, jaundice will be cured fast. 
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

My son was born in winter so there was not much sunlight and the weather was too cold to go out. I have bought vitamin D for baby to supplement the baby, but I don't use it often. If you want to use any medication, you must consult your doctor.
