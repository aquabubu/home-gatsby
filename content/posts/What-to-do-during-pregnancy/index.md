After checking the quick test and having good news, what will you do? - Of course you need some advice or information from your mother, friends or google things for sure.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

I have a friend who is a pediatrician so I’ve asked him many things. So, in this post, I will tell you some advice that you should know during your pregnancy. They’ve already worked for me so I hope you can find them useful too. 
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

## <span style="color:Green"> I want to have a Normal Vaginal Delivery. What should I do? </span>
The normal vaginal delivery depends on 3 factors including: pelvic, fetus, and fetal expulsion.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

Normally, if the weight of the fetus is small, crampy abdominal appears and pelvic is opened big enough, you probably have a normal delivery. Therefore, just take care of yourself carefully and don’t miss any periodic examination. When the day comes, the doctor will tell you whether you have a normal vaginal delivery or C-section.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

Now it is only possible to identify the pelvic area (large or not), which should be examined directly. But it's only relatively because the pelvic cavity may be wide if the fetus is small, narrow if the fetus is big.

## <span style="color:royalblue"> Listening to classical music helps the baby smarter? </span>
Some experts say that from 18 to 20 weeks, you and your baby can listen to classical music, and it's better to use loudspeaker than headphone. I did listen to some symphony but not frequently. You can search for the Baby Einstein’s collections on Youtube or any classical music that you like.

## <span style="color:orangered"> What to do to avoid premature birth? </span>
Premature birth depends on two factors: the fetus and the mother.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

The fetus: need regular checkups, screening abnormality, pregnancy tests to determine abnormal chromosomes, birth defects. During your pregnancy check-up, your doctor will advise you when to check so don't worry.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

The mother: The most important thing is to avoid injury to the private area. Secondly, avoid sepsis of private area, keep it dry. Urinary tract infection (UTI) is common during pregnancy because of changes in the urinary tract, therefore, it is a must to keep hygiene after urinating. In addition, during pregnancy, there are some maternal diseases also cause premature birth such as gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia, etc. This is an intensive problem, so it is best to go regular check-up and listen to the advice of your doctor.

###  Folic acid
When I was pregnant I bought folic acid supplement to drink every day. Folic acid is needed to protect the fetus from neural tube defects such as spina bifida. This is a disability occurring in the fetus because some of the neurons around the central nervous system are not completely closed, especially in the first 7 weeks of pregnancy. In addition, folic acid plays an important role in the development and division of cells in the baby's body.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}
Lack of folic acid leads to anemia, which is caused by a lack of vitamin B12. Moreover, it also makes the mother at high risk for miscarriage, preterm delivery, postpartum psychosis, and fetal malnutrition. Children at birth are also prone to cardiovascular disease, cleft palate if the mother is deficient in folic acid.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}
If you are trying to conceive, then take folic acid before about 3 months. You should ask your doctor before use. I used a Korean product from the beginning to the end of my pregnancy.

### Morning sickness 
Usually, in the first 3 months, the mother has a lot of morning sickness but will end up when you reach your second trimester. Each person has her own anti-morning sickness, here are some common ways:
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

  * Eating smaller meal and eat plenty of meals, avoid over-saturated or too hungry
  * Avoid fat, spicy and unpleasant smell foods
  * Prepare cake to eat (cake that has low butter, low fat) to avoid lowering sugar since it causes nausea.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}
In my case, I bring some fruits to my workplace such as banana, strawberry, grape. It worked for me.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

### Exercise
If the mother's condition is good, she can exercise about 20 to 30 minutes per day, seven days a week. Walking, swimming, yoga ... whichever way to practice, just avoid the heavy exercise (soccer, badminton, volleyball)
{: style="text-align: justify;"}
However, in my opinion, this period is quite sensitive, exercise may cause bleeding so I do not recommend you do any kinds of exercise.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

### Food
It requires 2500 kcal/day, the ratio of protein: sugar: fat is 2: 5: 3. But I ate as usual, just increased vegetables and fruit. I also drank plenty of water and fresh milk during my pregnancy. It is best to eat enough, eat plenty of grains, vegetables, meat, fruit, drink milk, avoid starch, sweets (eat more fish, eat at least 3 fish per week will help reduce the rate of premature birth). 
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

### Sleeping position
<figure style="width: 450px" class="align-center">

</figure>
The best position is “SOS” (sleep on side). Left side or right side are both fine. People say that it’s even better to sleep on your left side because it will increase the amount of blood and nutrients that reach the placenta and your baby. Keep your legs and knees bent, and put a pillow between your legs will make you feel more comfortable.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

### Travelling during pregnancy
Check with your doctor to see if you are able to go traveling (traveling by plane, train, bus). But after the first 3 months, it is the best time to travel because it helps relieve stress and the fetus at that time is not that big so it's more comfortable.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}
If you go traveling, don't forget to wear the seat belt to avoid injury. The lap belt should be placed below your belly, touching your thighs, low and snug on your hip bones (like the picture). Avoid sitting motionless for too long, sit and stretch your legs for blood circulation.

When choosing a place to go, be careful of Zika virus. In pregnant women, it may cause subsequent birth defects.

## <span style="color:olive"> Second trimester </span>
 
  * From 18 - 20 weeks, baby's very first movement appears and you can feel it.
 {: style="text-align: justify;"}
  * Eating, sleeping, and exercising is like the first trimester. This is the time to build a regular exercise habit, which will be good for your birthing.
 {: style="text-align: justify;"}
  * You should also consider the problem of stretch marks in your abdominal area. I used bio oil to apply on that area, but I didn't see any effect. But my friend used it and it worked for her. So it depends on each people body. 
{: style="text-align: justify;"}
  * When applying oil to your abdominal area, remember: Pour the oil into the palm of your hand and softly apply it to your abdomen. Remember to avoid to rub around your abdomen because it makes uterus contracting, which may lead to premature birth. I applied it continuously until birth, twice per day, before going to work and before sleeping.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

## <span style="color:mediumvioletred"> Third trimester </span>
 <figure style="width: 450px" class="align-center">
  <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/baby2.gif" alt="">

</figure>
  * At this time, you will feel tired, uncomfortable and heavier because the fetus size gets bigger. The mother will also feel the baby hiccup inside her abdomen, 3-4 times a day, but it's normal.
 {: style="text-align: justify;"}
  * I was quite lazy doing exercise but after 32 weeks I tried to walk at least 30min per day.
  * After 36 weeks, most likely your baby is already head-down. But if not, your doctor or midwife may suggest scheduling an external cephalic version (like I did). That will apply pressure to your abdomen to try to manipulate your baby into a head-down position. The lungs and organs are fully developed and more fat layers are added to help control body temperature after birth. 
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

  * After 37 weeks of pregnancy, you should think about how can you deliver your baby: Normal Vaginal Delivery or C-section. I ate pineapple until the day I gave birth (1-1.5 pineapple/week) because I heard it helps normal vagina delivery easier. DON'T EAT PINEAPPLE BEFORE 37 WEEK, IT LEADS TO PREMATURE BIRTH.

Finally, I hope you will have a safe and healthy pregnancy. :blue_heart:
