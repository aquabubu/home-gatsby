Recently I did some online shopping and found one **Japanese toner – Hatomugi Skin Lotion** (in Japan, they call skin lotion or skin conditioner instead of toner). This toner really surprised me because of its huge volume at a very cheap price 500ml/8,500krw (~$8.5). It is said that Hatomugi Skin Lotion is one of the best toners and loved by most of the Japanese women. So after using it for a while, I’m gonna review it now.

So, I have tried Hatomugi Skin Lotion as a lotion mask since it comes in a very big bottle. After removing the mask, I was totally disappointed with this toner, my skin got redness and look terrible.  I guess because it **contains alcohol**. In terms of a toner, it just softly moisturizes and smooths my skin without leaving any redness and the toner is absorbed fast and non-stick at all. One good thing is that this toner has a very slight scent that does not last long so you won't be bothered. And for the huge volume, it lasts up to 6 months so it's really economical.

And do I buy it again? I will not. I think it’s not a good product for my combination to dry skin. And the winter is coming so I need something that has better moisture effect. I think it is more suitable for oily skin and combination to oily skin rather than dry skin. However, if your skin is sensitive, then you should consider carefully before buying this since it has alcohol.
