Geojedo or Geoje island is the main island of Geoje City, located on the southern coast of Gyeongsangnam Province. This is Korea's second largest island, after Jeju Island. Geoje Island consists of many large and small islands with the blue coast and many attractions on them. Geoje is connected to Busan by an 8.2 km long bridge and a tunnel under the sea so the traffic is quite convenient.

In this post, I would like to introduce my trip to Geoje Island and share some experiences of places that I visited. For the foods and restaurants on Geojedo, please take a look here.

## <span style="color:mediumviolet"> Hakdong Mongdol Beach (학동몽돌해변) &  Gujora Beach (구조라해수욕장) </span> 

This is a famous beach in Geoje. The beach doesn't have white sand but full of pebbles. The locals say that these pebbles are as beautiful as the black pearls but I see them so-so. In fact, the pebbles here are mostly blue or dark blue, when the waves hit them, they get wet and change to "black pebbles". But the long beach looks nice, clean and clear. My family came here to play and pick up some pebbles.

Gujora beach is beautiful with the long sandy beach and very clean seawater under the blue sky. I took many beautiful photos here. :smile:

## <span style="color:deepskyblue"> Windy Hill (바람 의 언덕) </span>

This is a must-go place in Geoje island. The sceneries are so peaceful and wonderful except too many people here. Unfortunately, I went here on Chusoek holiday (Mid-Autumn Festival, the most feast in Korea) and the time wasn't right so many people + dark sky due to sunset. If you go there, I recommend you go earlier at around 7-8 a.m.

## <span style="color:green"> Oedo Botania (외도 보타니아) and Haekeumkang (해금강) </span>

This is the **Oedo botanical garden** on a small island. From Geoje Island, you can take a ferry ride to this island. Oedo Botania is a green plant paradise with more than 3,000 species of plants, very diverse and many strange plants. This place is worth to go. This island only has a cafe and a small souvenir shop. On the way back from Oedo Botania Garden, you will see the natural rocky island called Haekumkang. This is considered to be the second most famous landmark in Geoje and has ecological conservation value. Frankly, there are many people in the ferry want to see it so it's a bit uncomfortable.

### About Oedo

When the owners Changho Lee and Hosook Choi moved there in 1973, they tried to grow tangerines and raise pigs farm - but both failed. In 1976, they thought of creating a tourist island. In a long time from 1976 to 1994, the island was converted into a botanical garden and was opened in 1995.

For those who are fans of the K-drama **Winter Sonata**, botanical garden Oedo Botania is sure to be an interesting experience because this is where the drama's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvbsv5m354E" target="_blank">final episode</a> with the reunion of two main characters Kang Junsang and Jung Yoojin was filmed. The white villa located halfway up the mountain is also home to Kang Junsang in the drama.

### Tips

  * Before you go to Oedo Botania Island, you can download the Oedo Island App, which has voice guidance and explanations in English from the moment you board on the ferry. The island can be crowded during the summer and big holidays in Korea.

  * There is no hotel on Oedo so make sure you get the right ferry back to Geoje. When getting on the ferry, you will be issued a ticket with a number and you need to remember the number of your ferry and keep that ticket with you. Since it is scheduled to visit the Botania Garden for only around 1,5hour, remember to make your trip in time.

  * To book the ferry ticket, I booked a course of Oedo and Haekeumkang at 2:30 p.m directly from the <a href="http://www.hggtour.net/main.php" target="_blank">Haekeumkang Ferry Terminal</a> (해금강유람선) as our pension was near this place. But there are many docks which have ferries go to Oedo. 

  * The island's opening hours are from dawn to sunset. Oedo closes on New Year's Eve and New Year's Day. The opening day is also depending on weather conditions, if weather forecasts are bad, the ferry will not go.

## <span style="color:darkcyan"> Memisong (매미성) </span>

Memisong is like a European castle made of stone. Its location next to the coast makes this place ideal for great photoshoots. It is said that in the old days, there was a big storm so a family was drifted to this island, then they built this castle.

This place is just like a fairytale castle, so beautiful. But few foreign tourists know this place, mainly Korean people know. I heard in Geoje there are quite a lot of hidden nice places. I really like this place, during my trip to Geoje, I like this place most, but when I was there, it's also crowded. : laughing:

## <span style="color:orangered"> Pension </span>

I came to Geoje by car so I was able to drive along the coast and visit any places and time schedule was flexible. I rent a pension in the south of the island called **Geoje Cheonnyeon Miso pension (거제 천년 의 미소 펜션)**. Right next to the pension is a small pebbles beach, quite similar to the Hakdong Mongdol beach, but smaller and not that beautiful. As the pension is in the south, I can't watch the sunrise, and it's so far from Okpo neighborhood that I couldn't go anywhere at night, just walk around the beach near my pension. If you travel there, I think it's better to choose a hotel near Okpo neighborhood.
