It can’t be denied that wearing makeup gives us a beautiful out-looking and make us feel more confident when going out. And recently in Korea, the cushion appears as the savior for those who need the natural and thin-layer makeup. And more than that, it can give you a natural dewy makeup as many Korean celebrities.

**IOPE Air Cushion** is one of the best cushions in Korea and loved by many girls. Actually, when I asked my Korean friend about this IOPE cushion and HERA cushion, they said that the IOPE cushion is better so I chose it  I bought it online at a discount price 33,600krw, ~$33 (the original price is 42,000krw, ~$40). IOPE is one of the mid-range brands of Amore Pacific – a huge cosmetic corporation in Korea. IOPE products are based on highly-enriched herbal extracts and cutting-edge scientific technology.

So, what is cushion? – It’s a kind of liquid CC/BB cream - very loose and placed in a plastic tray, with a sponge preventing the liquid from flowing out. It also provides a puff to slightly press on the sponge to take the cushion and pat onto face.

**Lines and shades**

There are 4 lines of this cushion: Natural, Cover, Intense Cover, and Matt Long Wear. Each line has different shades. I chose the Intense Cover since I have some acne scars and the Natural Beige N21 because I thought it could give me the natural look and suit my skin tone.

## How to use

**Before makeup**: After the skincare steps, take a sufficient amount by using the puff and pat on the face.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

**After makeup**: After foundation or makeup base, or whenever you need a sunblock, slightly pat this cushion on the face.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

I usually do the skincare steps first, then sunblock and this cushion. Finally, I use the Innisfree Green Tea Mist to finish.

**My experiences with this cushion**

Well, I think that this product is good except its coverage. Even it’s the Intense Cover, it doesn’t work well on all my acne scars though the makeup looks still good.  However, it can last up to 6 hours without re-applying and looks smooth on my face and my skin doesn’t feel dry at all. It doesn’t move into the lines around my eyes and the corner of my lips either. But it’s not as good as I expected compared to its expensive price.

After all, I think this cushion is good, especially for the combination and very few blemishes skin. If your skin has pimples or scars like mine, it can be used together with a concealer

**Tips**:  If you want a **dewy** skin with this cushion, you’d better put a thin layer of oil (coconut oil, avocado oil,… or vaseline) on your face before the cushion. Just a THIN layer is enough, if you put on too much, your pores will be clogged and your skin is oily, not dewy. And for the concealer, you can put on concealer first, then the cushion, it'll give you more natural makeup.
