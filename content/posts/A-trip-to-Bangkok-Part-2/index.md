Let's continue to see the places in Bangkok. So, in the <a href="http://aquabubu.com/blog/travel/A-trip-to-Bangkok-Part-1/" target="_blank">last post </a>, I talked about some places and stopped at the Wat Arun and from there, I went to Wat Pho and Grand Palace.

##  <span style="color:red">  Wat Pho & Grand Palace </span>

**Wat Pho** is a well-known temple located behind the Grand Palace. This temple has the biggest golden Buddha statue in the world. Their temple architecture is quite special and has many towers, many colorful patterns. Fortunately, I met Thai music troupe so I stopped to watch. Along with the biggest Buddha statue in the world, it is also famous for the number of many golden Buddha statues up to hundreds or even thousands.

The ceiling of this temple is very high, around three times higher than human height so it was cool, even without air conditioning or fan. Under the feet of the Buddha carved many small square grids. There is a sign "Please do not touch" but I found that every people touched it, especially the Thai because they believe that if touching the feet of the Buddha, they will be blessed. On one side of the corridor, there is a series of vases and people will put the penny into each vase. I heard that these vases symbolize the tribulations of life (I don't know how many of them). And for every penny they put in, they will be freed.

It is quite close from Wat Pho to the Grand Palace, costing 500 baht (~$15) by boat for foreigners and free with the Thai. Thailand is good at promoting tourism that as soon as we entered the gate, they offered us an English-speaking tour guide, of course, it cost 300 baht (~$9). We didn't take it because there are many numbered map, guides and miniature models of the temple to determine where you are. The Grand Palace is quite large so it is best to follow the numbered map and it is also the shortest route.

**Grand Palace** is a complex of buildings at the heart of Bangkok. It has been the residence of Kings of Siam (and later Thailand) since 1782. The present monarch currently resides at Chitralada Palace, but the Grand Palace is still used for official events.

And again, if you wear shorts, short skirts and tank top, you must hire a long cloth to cover. As the place is quite crowded, bring your own cloth to avoid time-consuming if possible. But I heard that due to the riots, the palace has refused to bring electronic equipment (including cameras, telephones ...) and the cloth is not for rent anymore, so you have to buy one at 50 baht (~$1.5). The modern area is not accessible because the royal is still using. This area has European style and there was a guard wearing European uniform.

## <span style="color:brown"> Chatuchak Weekend Market and JJ Green Night Market </span>

Chatuchak is the largest market in Thailand and **one of the world’s largest weekend market**. It is opened on Sat and Sun, 9 a.m – 6 p.m. We got to this market by sky train (BTS) to Mo Chit Station and took exit No.1, then we followed the crowd until seeing a small entrance.

After leaving Chatuchak Market, we accidentally found out JJ Green Market with some coolest old things. This market is mostly Thai, fewer tourists and mainly sell very nice retro things.

## <span style="color:deepskyblue"> Madame Tussauds and Ocean Park </span>

Located on the 6th floor of **Siam Discovery Center**, there is just one thing to do in this no old-fashioned wax museum: SELFIE. You can have a chance to rub shoulders with world celebrities, heads of state, sports heroes and heroines,… Madame Tussauds launched its 10th attraction in Dec 2010, with 70 wax figures and still counting. It took us around 1.5 hours to explore this museum.

Leaving Siam Discovery to Siam Center, there is an **Ocean Park** in the basement. Ocean Park in Thailand is literally “ocean” park, that is just the animals in the sea to see.

There is a small place to **touch the starfish**. Employees will guide and help you clean your hands.

## <span style="color:green"> Baiyoke Tower II </span>

It is an 88-story, skyscraper hotel, which is the **tallest hotel in Southeast Asia and the seventh-tallest all-hotel structure in the world**. This tallest building in Bangkok providing the beautiful view of the city with colorful lights. Luckily, I was sitting in a private two-person table right next to the glass window to enjoy the scene. The food is not delicious with usual dishes such as squid, fried potato chips... like a normal buffet. Generally, it only has the beautiful view.

## Transportation

There are **2 types of bus** in Thailand (3-4 baht to 6-7 baht): with and without air-conditioner. The one without air-conditioner looks older than another. There are two persons in the bus, the driver, and a ticket seller. They don't speak English, so you need to put pictures or pointing to the map so they will stop at where you need.

The **Bangkok Mass Transit System**, commonly known as the BTS or the Skytrain.

You'd better **check the weather in Bangkok before going there**. On a not too hot sunny day, you can have many beautiful photos. This is the end of my trip to Bangkok. Hope it can help you guys have an overall view of this capital city of Thailand if you wanna travel here.
