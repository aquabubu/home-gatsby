I’m gonna review about the **<span style="color:green"> Nara Deer Park </span>**, which is a pleasant and spacious park with freely roaming deer – one of the places I have been on my trip to Japan.

**<span style="color:saddlebrown"> A bit of history </span>**: Nara was the capital of Japan since 710 to 794 and the cradle of the Tenpyo culture. Kasuga-jinja Temple, Kofuku-ji Temple, Todai-ji Temple (Unesco World Heritage Site)... were built or relocated to Nara during this time. Besides the temples and monasteries, this place also has Nara Park - a unique historical park nowhere, there is a harmonious combination of the beauty of green nature.

The **<span style="color:crimson"> special hallmark of Nara Park </span>** is the roaming deer all over the campus. The deer live in Nara Park, which was respected in ancient times, considered as messengers of the Kasuga-taisha Temple. They are wild animals that have not been nurtured and designated a national natural heritage, and widely known by the name "Nara deer".

Around the park, you can see many stands selling **Nara-senbei cake** - the favorite food that can be fed to these deer. You can also buy beautiful souvenirs here. But once you feed them, you will be quickly surrounded by deer. It seems like Nara deer are quite tame, but they have a warning so just be careful.

There are many <span style="color:royalblue">**attractions** </span> near the deer park, including:

  * **Kofukuji Temple**, built as early as the beginning of the 8th century by the powerful clan Fujiwara. The majestic five-story pagoda is a symbol of the temple.

  * **Kasuga Taisha**, one of Japan's oldest and most important Shinto shrines, known for its many stone lanterns and mystical atmosphere due to its location in the woods.

  * **Todaiji Temple**, home to the world's largest wooden building and Japan's largest bronze statue of Buddha (15-meter tall).

  * **Yoshikien or Isuien Gardens**, great examples of Japanese garden arrangement.

## How to get there

Nara Park is a 5 min walk from Kintetsu Nara Station or about 20 min walk from JR Nara Station. Or, the park can be reached by bus. There are many stops around the park.

You will walk a lot around the park so it’s better to wear comfortable clothes and shoes. Unlike the temples in Korea, there is entrance fee for most of the temples in Japan so you need to pay if you wish to enter the Todaiji Temple, additional fees to enter some buildings and treasure halls in Kasuga Taisha, Kofukuji Temple, Isuien Garden (but it's not a matter since the cost is just around 500 JPY).
