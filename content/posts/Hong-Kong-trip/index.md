In this post, I will introduce the attractions that I've visited during my trip in Hong Kong.

## <span style="color:Green"> At the airport </span>
After finishing all the procedure, I was walking around the restricted area inside the airport because there were so many shops. Once you leave this area, you will not be able to get back in. After that, I took all the maps (especially Hong Kong map and MTR map), they are located near the customer service counter.

I bought two Otopus cards labeled Train Express Ticket at the central information counter, HK$150 (~$19), including HK$50 for deposit and HK$100 for recharging card. Before I left Hong Kong, I returned that cards to get back the excess money and my deposit but it cost HK$10 for the service. I also bought a Hong Kong Tourist SIM card 3G-free for 5 days, it cost HK$69 at the 7-Eleven store in the airport.

I went to Disneyland by MTR. A design with lots of Mickey Mouse on the MTR Disney looks so nice, reminding me of the Disney channel I usually watch. You should go there early and arrive at Disney Land 10 a.m for saving your time to play. For more information, check Disney Land <a href="https://www.kkday.com/en/product/2301" target="_blank">website</a>. Buying tickets online on this site will also be cheaper.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

However, do not bring food or drink into this place. As my experience here, you should follow the show's schedule, eg: see the schedule, if show A is about to start, then you should move to the area of A first, then move to the area of the next show. I missed two shows because of wasting time moving around since Disneyland is very wide. I played outdoor games first then indoor games. There are fireworks at 9 p.m, nice!
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

I didn't eat much in Disneyland although the Market Home Bakery on the Main Street in here has the hot dog - cheap, but crispy and taste good. You can eat later since the foods in Hong Kong are really delicious that can't be missed.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

## <font color="#CE9CF8">CHI LIN</font> - <font color="##3818EC">NAN LIAN GARDEN</font> - <font color="#05A3D9">WONG TAI SIN</font> - <font color="#7EE374">PEAK TRAM</font> - <font color="#DD103A">TSIM SHA TSUI CLOCK TOWER</font>

To go to these places, I spent a whole day and using a lot of MTR. So, my advice is to buy a Day Pass Ticket HK$55 if the total fee for the MTR at each station you pass is higher than HK$55. If not, Otopus card is still okay.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

### <font color="#CE9CF8">Chi Lin Nunnery</font>  & <font color="#3818EC">Lian Garden</font>

When arriving at Diamond Hill Station, go out of Exit C2, follow the signs and walk for around five minutes. Chi Lin Nunnery was renovated in Tang dynasty style. It is a large temple complex of elegant wooden architecture including a series of temple halls, some of which contain gold, clay and wooden statues representing divinities such as the Sakyamuni Buddha and bodhisattvas.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

Nan Lian Garden is a public park also built in the style of the Tang dynasty. Its scenic garden is meticulously landscaped in which every hill, rock, body of water, plant and timber structure has been placed according to specific rules and methods.

### <font color="#05A3D9"> Wong Tai Sin Temple </font>

{: style="text-align: justify;"}

The name Wong Tai Sin means the "Great Immortal Wong", is the divine form of Wong Tai Sin, a Taoist hermit from Zhejiang. Home to three religions (Taoism, Buddhism, and Confucianism), it’s not only a scenic attraction but also an important religious center.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

There are also sortilege and many things to see. In the temple, there is a statue of Yue Lao (the god of marriage) and free red strings of fate for everyone to wish.

{: style="text-align: justify;"}

At **Peak Tram terminus**, I took the bus to go back to Star Ferry (~15min). You can buy Star Ferry ticket, it will pass by Kowloon and stop next to the Clock Tower.

## <font color="#DD103A">TAI O </font> - <font color="#86136A">NGONG PING</font> - <font color="#3FBCC6"> TEMPLE MARKET </font> - <font color="#3818EC">JADE MARKET</font>

### <font color="#DD103A">Tai O </font>

From Tung Chung MTR station, I took bus 11 to go to Tai O (every 20min, HK$11, ~1hour to arrive). At Tai O, I took a boat to see the pink dolphin (HK$20) (but it depends on the weather to see the dolphin, I was unlucky because of the gloomy day). Tai O is very peaceful and beautiful with romantic scenes and delicious seafood. I could see the eagle flying around the mountain. The map is also in English, so convenient.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

I also went to Tai O market and enjoyed the food here. The market opened late (after 11 a.m) but the food was amazing.

###  <font color="#86136A"> Ngong Ping </font>

I took bus 11 again to back to Tung Chung MTR station. Next to the bus stop is Tung Chung Cable Car Terminal. I chose the Ruby Cable which has a transparent bottom. You can buy cheaper cable ticket <a href="https://www.klook.com/activity/45-ngong-ping-360-hong-kong/?category=2-sightseeing-hong-kong/" target="_blank"> here</a>.

I spent more than 2 hours to go around Ngong Ping village, Tiantan Buddha, and Wisdom Path.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

### <font color="#3FBCC6"> Temple Market </font> & <font color="#3818EC">Jade Market </font>

The Temple market is more famous to locals because there is a big temple at the market and the road next to it is full of counters for fortune-teller or palm reading. During the festival, this road will have a parade procession of gods, very majestic. This night market, which starts ramping up from around 6 p.m, sells many kinds of souvenirs and even sex toys at temple street .
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

**Address**: Temple Street, Yau Ma Tei, Kowloon

**How to get there**

  * MTR Yau Ma Tei Station, Exit C, turn onto Temple Street at Man Ming Lane
  * MTR Jordan Station, Exit A. Turn right onto Jordan Road and then take another right onto Temple Street

Walk along Nathan Road to Kansu Street from Temple Market, then continue along Kansu Street until you reach the Jade Market. This market is full of stalls selling everything from China’s ornamental green stone to pearls, precious gems, and antique items. Jade Market is an ideal place to get your hands on fabulous jewelry pieces, and great gifts back home.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

## <font color="royalblue"> OCEAN PARK </font>

**Address**: Ocean Park, Aberdeen, Hong Kong

From MTR Admiralty Station, take exit B and alight at the park. Getting on bus 629 (HK$10.6) to Ocean Park.

Cheap ticket <a href="https://www.klook.com/activity/23-ocean-park-hong-kong-hong-kong/?category=3-attractions-hong-kong%2F" target="_blank"> website </a> (HK$258).

At Ocean Park, it's not allowed to bring food but water. Ocean Park is so large. The shows are very interesting, especially the lovely animals. There are penguins, white foxes in the Antarctic, and seabirds in the Arctic (must watch the leopard seal doing Abs exercise show, so funny).
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

There is one room for different types of goldfish. There are also Brazilian spider, pandas, foxes, and even forest cockroaches. At 8 p.m, the 3D water show is really worth watching (just like the fireworks show at Disneyland).
